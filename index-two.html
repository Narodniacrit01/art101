					<h2>introduction:</h2>
					<p>I'm a third year anthropology student whos unable to comprehend th materials of this course
                        given that it is wildly out of my field of study. I'm a six foot nine trans woman who hates computers.
                        I defy the stereotypes about my people. MY interests are not computers but novels, hard books I have on my shelf
                        about the world around me that deepen my understadning. 
                    </p>
